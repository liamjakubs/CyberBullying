I always get fucking pissed when I see a man joke about the sexual abuse of another man. “Wow. Please she should come &amp; rape me too, some of us want.” “Mans is complaining. Nigga you gay? ” What foolishness, mocking and minimizing someone's pain for bants. Are you okay at all?

Men know sexism when they hear it. They appreciate it when they homeboy call them a dog but feel disrespected when they are called a bitch. Both mean dog but one specifies a female. It’s being compared to a female that is disrespectful because that is associated with being weak.

I take your point these are not good examples of that point. As @rickygervais points out in Humanity - even rape jokes are funny, as long as the butt of the joke is not the rape victim. These jokes are not that funny but the targets are politicians not gay people

Cancel culture is a fair thing to use when someone commits a crime like rape, pedophelia, sexual assault, that’s fine. But when you destroy someone’s career over a gay joke they said when they were fifteen, 9 years before they are fully developed. That’s where the line is drawn

I disagree with almost everything AOC says. Since I’m a female, if I call her a fucking bitch is that still misogyny? (I won’t even address the bigotry comment because you just started throwing out an accusatory word without understanding what it is apparently)

A male prison rape joke can be seen as just a rape joke tho, &amp; I think most people see it that way. My generation being raised after S28, being taught that being gay is completely normal, is way less likely to see that joke from a homophobic angle, than a generation brought up w/

So if there were no sexist jokes,there would be no rape and murder?That doesn’t make any sense.This is going off the basis that every man who kills a woman has the exact same reason for doing so,which is inherently false. When a man kills a man does he do it because he hates men?

you’re a sexist accusing people of sexism for a joke. a harmless joke. your “jokes” calling women dukes are not harmless. it’s a slur first of all, to gay women. and to women in general. it’s a part of rape culture. the disrespectful slurs are first.

A decent man who was willing to call a young female colleague a bitch? Maybe the reasons republicans are like that is because sexism is so engrained in your minds you think an ass like Yoho is a stand-up guy. AOC cares about the people, more than Yoho ever could.

Men are a target to sexual assault in movies just for laughs. I don't understand how rape jokes just go unnoticed because men usually aren't the victims. A lot of comedies also portray the ONLY gay person in the movie as a threat to straight people. They're not, rapists are.
So, feminists will trend #FeministsAreUgly and then complain how the fact #FeministsAreUgly is trending is proof of misogyny in society.  K.
Implying that being gay is something to be made fun of, or to bring shame upon people is about as hilarious as prison rape jokes. We're the good guys, we need to act like it.

People who still make rape jokes are the same ones who still call people “gay or fags”. Tell them to go fuck themselves and then go back to ignoring them the best you can. That’s the broken part of society that you can’t fix. You just fight for change and cheer as they die off.

Gay slur wordplay on record intro is the most hateful thing in recent rap memory. Makes Rick Ross' date rape joke endearing by comparison.
.@TedYoho If you're going to apologize, DO SO. Don't try to weasel out of it by saying you didn't call your female colleague a "fucking bitch" to her face, like that makes it acceptable. She found out you said it; own it and apologize for it. Don't be a 2-faced weasel, Ted.
They are just auditioning to work @FUNimation where gay jokes and rape jokes are tolerated. No surprise.
Isn't this actually racist since "female" is male AAVE or something? What I mean is: I've only ever heard black males refer to women as "female" and trust me, it is NOT a replacement for "bitch". If we wanna call you a bitch, we're not afraid to do so.
I don't care if we're best friends. I don't joke about rape, being gay or killing myself and I won't acknowledge you if you do.
1. Not every word you use comes from the 1600s, if you bothered to look it up and not its origin 2. "Let men be men", is literally used to represent rape culture 3. Thanks for proving you're sexist and homophobic 4. You're still gay because I've yet to mention my sexuality

Every female rapper should be their true self in their music. Don’t force cocky/bad bitch artists to act humble (because they’re too successful) &amp; don’t shove humility down every new girl’s throat. Meg is cocky now, when she’s as successful as Nicki, y’all will call it mean girl!
Most of my mutuals(guys) are trash. They make fun of a girl because they don’t like her. They make fun of gays. They make rape jokes and get butt hurt when someone calls them trash. I wanna unfollow all of them ughhhh

I was replying to a gay man about a joke he made, that told me he clearly doesn’t worry about his risk of rape or murder on a daily basis. The tweet made me laugh and then roll my eyes. I wasn’t inferring anything besides his blind spot.

Hey guys, so last night I learned I’m becoming an SJW because I don’t like rape jokes, the n word, the word faggot being used as an insult, or describing something as gay when it doesn’t suit you.

Sometimes I watch old tv shows or movies and I’m just in awe of how. Shitty people were (rape, gay, trans phobic jokes are not just normal but encouraged). Honestly people say they wish people weren’t so sensitive like no your jokes are marginalizing and they hurt people ok
Yes, they are, it depends who you are and what's you're personality. I am gay, and I do in fact laugh at gay jokes. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean we shouldn't. For the last time; learn what black humor means, it's just jokes we aren't going to rape anybody.

LGBT cinema really does need more happy endings. There’s an ongoing joke when we watch gay films that they end in rape and/or death, and although some are important stories to tell, we also sometimes deserve a fairytale ending. Good article!
What? He posted an image that depicts gay rape and murder and said that's what the gay candidate is doing after a loss. To those without context it looks homophobic. And thats one layer of his joke. "haha you didn't watch this movie I'm so clever lol you thought it meant x its y"

I'm just going to keep saying this. Jokes about gay sex and rape in jail is homophobic and really offensive , and I expect better out of a community leader like yourself.
it's hard to say let jokes be jokes when the joke become a tool to discriminate a certain group of people (e.g. rape jokes, gay jokes)
He wants a taste of his sister's fame, and is certified asshole. He's gay and is saying lesbians choose to be so,makes rape &amp; au oxide jokes
I see a lot of people defending these actions. Rape culture is about more than just “rape.” People see the word rape or harassment and say “but what if this,” “but they are gay,” “it was a joke,” “they family and just playing.”

which connects to my first post about the party I went to. it’s a big nono when straight ppl try to rape others right, but why does it seem like a joke to ppl when gay ppl do it? It’s just something I’ve noticed lately, obviously rape isn’t okay in any shape or form.
If Hart has tweeted that Emily’s face was a “fraternity’s billboard for date rape”, something tells me that she and Howard would have a problem with it, but hey it’s gay people, it’s just a “homosexual-related joke”. Clearly you have no respect for gay people!

No, but I have noticed that men make jokes about male rape and call men who reach out for emotional help "pussies" or "pansies" or "sissies" or "gay", while women encourage them to get whatever help they need and offer resources that, while female-centered, will assist men, too.

I know I'm supposed to care about the double standard with this cardi b "drugging and robbing" dudes story. But I all I hear in my head is that Chappelle line during a gay rape joke where he said "welp.. caught me slipping.... You gotta walk that shit off!"
People are free to make jokes at the expense of gay people or rape victims. I am also free to tell them that they're lazy, selfish cretins.
@NoBullshitGamin ...not what I'm looking at.  No.
I do not joke around about rape or child abuse. Your "political views" very well known, Molly. You think it's "child abuse" for a kid see a gay pride parade, yet you actually defended kids being at KKK rallies because they're holding a wooden crosses. The KKK BURNS CROSSES!!!
@BoycottBrandy I just wanted proof that feminism sheep believe the lie.
Niggas be like “females this, females that” like.. just call me a bitch so we can fight
Honey, Frankie Grande is absolute trash. He just wants fame. He’s also made rape jokes on TV, said being lesbian is a choice and degraded them below gay men and consistently uses his sisters name to build his ‘career’. And that’s the actual truth.

Hate rape jokes more than a hate tomatoes and gay jokes combined, regardless of intentions. U R PERMITTING SCEWED OPINIONS
Have you ever wondered why dudes joke about gay rape so much? @soundofmaddie has some thoughts: http://buff.ly/SslVjl
jokes about how guys must wish they were gay if they're going to prison. The only conclusion is that if you're gay prison rape must not be that bad. That's some 5th grade juvenile bullshit. A deep lack of understanding of gay people. Really disappointing.
Then will go out their way to praise some Latina woman who acts just like us but call us “bitches” and “females”

yet he didn’t rape a woman with a fork he threatened too as a joke as bad as it is it’s not as bad as actually raping her with it, also the gay man tried to molest x, you are all about defending yourself if someone sexually abuses you but if it’s someone you don’t like it’s wrong

Because teens/young adults can make funny memes about so many things, but for them to think it is funny to make rape memes, wheather real or fake should not be considered a "joke" being gay is not a "joke". Ask people who are on the other side of their "jokes" if it's funny.

Yes, Any comedian of any race should be able to use the word as they want. I.e. If someone makes a rape joke does that make them a rapist?no
Curious here would it be unjust to cancel someone if the repeatedly used a derogatory word for gay person? Or if another person made jokes about rape and pedophilia and added music and sound effects to it? Personally I would consider it just.

Sounds exactly opposite that to me, as if she's talking about prison "sex" (rape) as by choice rather than by force. I thought about it like this, if she's gay, I assume she doesn't think gay = bad, and it sounds like she thinks prison sex is gay sex, not rape. But it's a joke..

As a whole, for the MOST part, people don’t like hearing rape jokes. We tend to look at the person making the “joke” crazy for doing it. However, gay folks can’t have the same level of respect and response. They have to live with the fantasy of them being killed type of jokes

Never should've apologised. If you claim to be ok with offensive jokes but then say there's things you can't joke about, eg gays or rape, you are claiming that some people should be granted allowances others don't get. You can't then pretend to be virtuous or care about equality.

it’s ok to sing along using a homophobic slur because people on the streets use homophobic slurs (this insinuation is wildly crap btw) so it’s grand? Gay men’s pain doesn’t matter? Also, if a movie was normalising rape as ok, ban it. Paddy jokes don’t = to hate speech.

Hey @billmaher, as a rape survivor &amp; a gay guy I don’t find this funny in the least. Rape jokes aren’t yours to make. And gay sex isn’t punishment. But just to keep it fair, please let me know which women you’re willing to make a rape joke about. I’m sure it will be well received
@ATLsportsPayton Because if an obvious GA sports nut DIDN'T...that would explain it all.
I just had a heated argument with my colleagues when they made jokes about gay people having to tell them whether they are gay because you know "they'll rape you"
So much this and gay references as well as prison rape jokes. The man is a shoddy conman, there is plenty to work with.
Oh good, a gay rape joke ROSEMARY'S BABY parody. Hmm. I was mostly digging this for a while. #ThisIsTheEnd
But I've heard that rape jokes can be said by people who were raped, if you think about it everyone has made a sexist joke. Same with gay and racist jokes

Elected law makers call female colleagues "fucking bitches" on Capitol Hill and expect a pass because they were acting "passionately." And we wonder why female federal judges are being targeted by their passionately devoted supporters.
well the police are now free to do what they want to people with a Klan President & DOJ Director. Everyone is a target for beating, rape, murder as it is now just a joke if your a minority, gay or a Muslim.

Prison rape jokes and “lol gay sex” jokes and “homophobia is just repressed gay people” aren’t funny and are harmful.
She was always controversial. I don't get it. She's done rape jokes, holocaust jokes, abortion jokes, racial jokes, gay jokes, etc. She steam rolls mine fields regularly but they had to find some esoteric screen shot of her in blackface to cancel her?
Her ideas aren’t acknowledging misogynistic patriarchal views, they are enforcing them & saying that using our bodies as leverage is the only way to get bodily autonomy. It’s sexist &amp; problematic &amp; doesn’t account for rape or gay women or trans men.
There's funny & there's douche worthy. Not funny joke about rape, prejudice, racism, gay bashing, etc? In current culture? Die in a fire.

Homophobia isn't ok, but anything goes in comedy. You definitely can't draw the line at gay jokes in a show that regularly makes jokes about slavery, pedophilia, disabled people, rape, religion, and the Holocaust.
Cracked is improving in a lot of ways, but there are a few that seem to want to cling to the old ways, making rape jokes and gay jokes.
Simple categorisations of groups of people are not hugely helpful here. There are plenty of folk in the world who are super sexist, but still condemn the threatening of women with baseball bats. Or who don't support gay marriage, but strongly oppose corrective-rape rhetoric.

See, the reason you lose your job for making "muh edginess" pedo rape jokes in the early 2010's is because you were retards and used your real names. I called a thousand people gay n*gg*rs in Call of Duty and will never face the music.
Really top work. Reckon his response to gays being bum rape jokes was so pavlovian he didn't even notice. Just regarded it as punctuation.
if the stage gay is queer baiting then thats obv not ok but it rlly just sounds like an in the moment kind of thing- im not going to address the vines in the thread bcs they r made to be jokes- the rape joke thing,fan tweet thing, and fucking over ryan &amp; jon bothered me tho
You should be humiliated Kat! You are awful!!! #MKR
Call me a bitch but I’ll cancel QUICK if a female doing a service in her house but has all these RULES and bullshit. Like bitch females in an actual shop don’t even do all this. BYE
A female is never my problem it’s never the female it be you bitch ass niggas we call boyfriend we really need to worry about the female in the same boat she getting lied to and led on just as well ladies WAKE UP stop letting these niggas manipulate your brain
I know it was a joke bruh but that doesn’t change the fact that he was talking about “little girls” masturbating and having a “gay twink fetish”. That combined w the shit he said abt it being part of a man’s primal nature to rape a woman doesn’t sit well w me.
Why do people feel the need to joke using rape, gay or retarded?! Learn a different adjective!

When I'm passionate about something that I disagree with a female on, I don't call her an f'ing bitch. That's not being passionate. That's called being an asshole and that is exactly what Yoho is.
He has used the "n" word on more than one occasion. He recorded the videos, edited the videos, and left the use of the "n" word in them and uploaded them anyway. He also made many rape jokes, used "retard" "gay" and "autistic" as insults. Racism isn't his only issue.
Oh yes the 1980 was great except it wasn’t. Being gay was a crime, but rape in marriage wasn’t. What you mean is it was easier to be sexist racist and homophobic in the 1980. And even if you think that you still can’t use data from 40 years ago to support your theories
Misogyny is an interesting she's always punished for being outspoken. A congressman call her "disgusting" &amp; a "fucking bitch" on the steps of the Hill. Said asshole apologizes evoking his daughters &amp; god and then later rescinds his apology. Yeah, her support will be female.

@SnugRailgun She blocked me and I blocked her, why is that sexual abuse apologist @Auragasmic in my TL?
yeah he made some transphobic jokes about trans women and Caitlyn Jenner. He also made gay jokes and rape jokes
I will stand up for female sports women that work all their lives only to be knocked out in a ring by a biological man, or the woman that cycles everyday only to be beaten by a biological man. I will stand for those women even if you call me a trans phobic bitch. I am a woman.
so racist jokes religious jokes abortion jokes rape jokes 9/11 jokes literally ANYTHING else is fair play. but not gay jokes.

The World is too sensitive these days, simple joke and people get angry. No more space for humour/sarcasm on racist, rape, gay, men/women, politics. The fact that people had to be careful with subject they chose &amp; mindful on how it's affects others makes the world a hurtful place

As part of the gay community I feel insulted by gunn's homophobic "joke". I know that one less ticket sale won't make a difference to that wanker's pockets but I don't think I'll see The Suicide Squad on cinemas. Let's also remember he deleted 10K jokes about rape and pedophilia.

If this is cool, I'm assuming no jokes are off limits? Gay, Rape, handicap, trans, racist??. Because all of a sudden we're not so sensitive anymore . I think it's funny too, just checking to see if everyone's bout it like this implies. Dark humour &gt;&gt; respectful humour

I understand on some level, but still disagree. Gay jokes were meant to mock homosexuals- yet they still opened minds forced people to recognize that homosexuality was everywhere and even normal. Prison rape jokes are often meant to mock those affected, but expose the issue.

How diluted do you have to be to believe repeatedly screaming homophobic slurs, racial slurs, and producing 4-minute-long gay rape jokes are just common bloopers? You don't get to decide that calling somebody a faggot over and over isn't a big deal.
People that make trans/gay/rape/feminist jokes swear they're so clever. When really they're just uneducated, insensitive, &amp; ignorant.
Rape and murder of women, Pedophilia, Jew jokes and calling your buddy gay is not actually the height of funny.

Guys, piece of advice, rape jokes are NEVER funny. I don't know much about women as a gay man, but that I tell you with certainty.
Rape, Gay, &amp; Racial jokes still runnin via special, a decade after CS, blessed . Remember thou, boo'd by DET &amp; feminist tried to F him up.

I'm being oppressed at school worse than a weight scale being oppressed by a tumblr feminazi
Question - since when is calling a female colleague a "Fucking Bitch" equated as being treated as an equal? So if you were to call one of your female associates one as she walked away, the two of you would share a laugh? Your form of equal does not equal respect.
But if you call a man a bitch it’s an insult, and if you say a woman has balls it’s because she’s strong. We need to stop this gender bias female thing. Balls are about the most tender thing on the planet ever try tapping one? Ovaries can take a pounding, and bounce right back.
never said i don’t think im a female, i just said it makes me uncomfortable when men call women females. it feels very dehumanizing. and you’re wrong, i’m absolutely a bitch, people just don’t notice
I will never understand why 'gay' or 'rape' jokes are a thing
Considering James made a joke about the rape allegations, this was probably his doing... but not funny and harry shouldn't of said it. Moore is far-right; he thinks being gay is perversion, that women should stay at home and is racist.
Friday morning workplace jokes have moved from gay jokes to rape jokes. I guess it's time for headphones.
No gay jokes- homosexuals would never have broken the ice. No prison rape jokes, tell me honestly, how many of you think you would have any idea what I'm talking about with that?
i meant i’ve never heard of a female that lets a guy call them a bitch
No they can't. making a gay joke and saying gay people are caused by child rape are not interchangeable. He's progressive in the same way that intellectual design in public school is pro-science.

I agree with you, Darrell, that gay prison jokes are funny. Do the crime, pay the time. Anyway, Podhoretz’s cowering is about being accused of racism, not about funny &amp; accurate prison rape jokes.

You write, "There is no causal link between men refusing to “call out” a sexist joke and the rape and murder of a stranger." Wrong.

The funny thing abt people (male & female) who have a tendency to call a woman "a fucking bitch" is that they'll do it behind the woman's back, then deny it when caught. If they ever grew a pair and said it to our faces, we fucking bitches might muster up some respect for them.

Coin toss: To give a damn, or not. The joke is what it is, but comes from someone who seethes about the nearest whiff of a gay joke. If we observe that most of those are also rape jokes, the point stands out because the harassment joke attacks an anti-harassment activist.

We shouldn't forgive racism, homophobia or rape jokes! We should get rid of them! Its not about forgiving, its about having human decency. U can be funny without calling black ppl the n word or saying gays should be stoned.

It’s not a gay rape joke which I often complain about. It’s an observation about a man that has frequently claimed he can’t control his libido. I simply made an observation that he won’t be having sex in prison. So get that right. Thanks.

Sometimes we are raised in ways that make us immune to jokes that are insensitive. Black jokes, gay jokes, rape jokes have been normalized over years of consistent supremacy, inequality &amp; patriarchy. It is time we ponder on it &amp; make this come to an end. Speak up when necessary.

Enough With Gay Jokes, But Men Are So F**ken Gay. A Gay Can Handle A 5 Some Rape, But A Man...Wa Idibala
If making jokes about molesting children are merely jokes and nothing more, then surely you’d have no problem with people making jokes about blacks, Jews, trannies, gays, fat women, ugly women, and—here’s a spicy one— rape. Right???
why is everyone joking about how he can’t inhale when his friend is using gay as a slur off camera and he agrees with what his friend said.... this kid has been cancelled since he laughed at a rape joke
The problem is not the joke, it's the context. When David Brent says "I think there's been a rape up there" we laugh at him for being pathetic, not at rape. When Mark and Jez discuss gay sex in Peep Show, we don't laugh at gay people, but at Mark's discomfort of the conversation.

you call me a bitch but a bitch is a female dog and a dog barks and bark comes from trees tree is nature and nature is beautiful so thanks for the compliment!

It's another example of how sexism impacts men. Men who admit to being sexually assaulted by another man or women due to sexist perceptions about men. If you're rape by a man you're "gay" and if a woman does it then "what man doesn't have sex with a women." So its a moot point.
@xWriters_Blockx Can't forget it...never heard about it...

Who are you to decide what is NOT offensive for the gay community? Do you tell rape victims not to get offended by rape jokes too? guess not. Guess your opinion of not being offensive is because you know nothing about our community and decided for us that is NOT offensive.
Bitches be getting trains ran on them But get mad when you call the female. My bad subway surfer

My thing was that I don’t think Bill Maher was trying to do a “joke about rape” or “joke about gay people’s sex habits”- I think he was saying “Cohen is going down and he’s not going to like the aspects of prison life stereotypically depicted in mass media, but he deserves it”
can we start cancelling men who call women “females” and “bitches”
nothing too surprising: fuck, sexist, slavery, rape, any sort of clearly political word you can imagine, and especially relevant in my case, gay.
100% agree. Gay guys who talk about preying on straight guys, even as a joke, should be aware that they’re basically advocating rape.

I don't know many people who confuse sex with rape. The point is that the "joke" is both trivilizing rape and stigmatizing gay sex. Your clarification is completely unnecessary.

I think there’s a certain leeway for offensive comedy, comedy is often making fun of things and it’s going to offend some people, but if the only reason the joke is supposed to be funny is because it’s about a gay, black, or trans person, or rape or something ... it’s not comedy.
People think rape jokes and gay jokes are still funny
MTV has continuously failed to condemn all violent acts that weren’t directly physical. Excusing the rape of a challenge contestant (even filming it), and continuing to cast Zach despite his sexist hate speech abt women and gays, harassing Sam and jonna. It’s actually really sad.

These are some of the replies my friend had received. As you can see from the screenshot, he is takes rape very lightly and even make jokes about them. Even worse, he is also a homophobe who mentioned killing gays and yet enjoy watching lesbians for his “pleasures”.

we used to call them bitches, female was a big step sir calm down
our reasoning: the joke had rape implications, pedophilia implications, and used two of the few, if not only gay people in the game to make it, and it's not a good joke in any way shape or form your reasoning: mean ess jay double yoos took muh funnee joek away and now me sad :(

Recently I was dragged by someone in the community for being both pregnant and anti-rape jokes. I told him I would expect to be treated better by someone in my community and was told I know nothing about the gay community. I’ve been queer the majority of my life.
@She_TheWolf Are you a feminist?
being gay does not give you the god damn right to make rape jokes towards a girl
its 2020 and ppl still use gay as an insult, still making rape / racist jokes and some are still racists??? is it that hard to be a descent human being?? grow tf up.

@IanOKParty that last tweet proves I am the only one doing gay rape nerd jokes in this town.
People give words power. Go watch a woman with her friends call each other "Bitch" as a term of endearment. Now, you go ahead and try and call one of your female friends, girlfriend, or wife a "Bitch" and see what happens
I'm sure by banning them they will learn very quickly that we don't like sexist racist bigots that kill gays and rape victims
I love the subtle gay rape joke on spongebob
You know you've made it as a strong female leader when your male peers call you a bitch. Dominant females in positions of authority are threats to old cranky white men

I’ve literally said that theyre big weirdos, anyone that makes rape jokes I’ll unfollo them and your correct it does reinforce rape culture, same race jokes reinforce racism, gay jokes reinforce homophobia. if I say a joke about killing people it doesn’t mean I’m capable of it
I agree entirely on prison being a special case. I apologize, I was unclear. I was using the ubiquity of prison rape jokes in pop culture as a heuristic measure of how widespread the straight fear of gay rape might be in the broader culture.
Making gay jokes doesn't make you homophobic. Making black jokes doesn't make you racist. THEY ARE JOKES. Anyone &amp; anything is up for grabs in comedy. Rape jokes. Dead baby jokes. Dead baby rape jokes. ALL OF IT.

Again, you don't know what he's called other men. Asshole. Dick. Moron. Etc. A the same as calling a woman a bitch. Here you are hiding behind gender as well. A man can't call a woman a name because she's a female?

I read a bit of the controversial novel that gave rm vicarious satisfaction & I’m appalled. It was all explicit violent rape &amp; extreme misogyny. But people only care about the gay sex “namjoon gay” jokes when this book is the epitome of horrific violence, abuse &amp; rape of women.

My mother in law is like that about her dog. I jokingly call her dog a bitch, (hence she being an actual female boston terrier), she flips out. My wife does it, it’s all fun and games.
Not a huge loss, gaming montages super annoying and unimpressive, made racist jokes, said she likes gays as long as it's not in her face (big warning there), teenager who makes trigger and rape jokes. Hmm.. I'm so sad :'(

Yea ok I did not get her say lying bitch ... gee I must now learn how to “slow down the words until it fits your narrative. The female reporter did in Fact call her that.. slow this..sheeeepllle

@CampbellPaton I'm not sexist but the Canadian anthem should not be changed... It's tradition we all know now that men and women are equal.

I don't know, any kind of joke about mental illness, cancer, race, being 'gay', human rights, or rape isn't funny and just distasteful
I always ignore when people get them mixed up bc they always call me a “sexist straight white male who hates women” even tho I’m a feminine gay man like... it amazes me that people don’t know the difference between rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.

I hate how the world puts gay people on a pedestal. Like it’s ‘wrong’ to joke about them, mention them in songs etc but people stay joking about slavery, rape and poverty amongst black people. Why are gays excluded? Fuck that
I don't like people making what they call "gay" jokes and using real life issues/trauma such as rape and molestation in the process

Let's talk about men calling men bitches. Is THAT okay? Because stigmas shift. Meanings change. Personally, I want to destigmatize and get less offended. However, referring a whining dog to a female is disgusting. My mother taught me better than that. What if I call Trump one?
@HegartyKatie @BlaBluebBlib79 @kelly_o_hara Unless you compare women and men with same profession and experience you are just a sexist.

Literally every gaming discord, chat in any game. Unless you're completely blind to all the referencing the n word, rape jokes...it doesn't take long. Especially if someone brings up anything vaguely "political" like gay people existing
1. No one's forcing you to like rape jokes. 2. Only a bitch is offended by sexist jokes. 3. Homophobic jokes are gay. 4. Jew shouldn't be such a joke Nazi. Anyone who labels something "problematic" has already lost the argument by proving they can't cope with humour.
I hope to someday convince my brothers, cousins, etc. of two facts: 1) rape/gay jokes are NOT funny. 2) asexuality is a thing that exists.
Boys that call girls ‘bitches’ and ‘females’ are one of my least favorite people..notice how I didn’t say men
This sounds like a great topic for discussion, doc. I know so many females who call themselves bitches, and are independent, strong-willed, and very aggressive. Nevertheless they are generally nice, kind, and very successful persons.
@Arsenick3 "I'm just selectively highlighting women who meet the stereotype I'm fishing to confirm. HOW IS THAT SEXIST"
I often can't believe how, in 2019, there is still an abundance of comedy where the sole punchline to a joke is: 1. A person is gay 2. Prison rape 3. Someone's dialect 4. Using a female pronoun instead of a male pronoun
Wow you sure are homophobic, as if taking it in the ass is somehow an insult. I might not be gay but I have many friends who are in the LGBTQ com. and you're being rather offensive just bc of this revealing twitter spat. Why are you being a rape apologist, sexist and homophobic?

Some jokes require an apology in my opinion. Beating gay children is one example for me. Is there anything that offends you? Jokes about your race? Your religion? Your appearance? Rape? Incest? I mean we each decide where we draw the line. Beating gay children is a line for me.

I suppose so. If someone made a joke about Sarah Sanders or Kellyanne getting raped, like “stretch that pussy Kellyanne,” would it be funny? Gay rape is still funny. Why?
No. It’s being used to call them gay, like boys a certain age do to their frenemies. It’s like a prison rape joke.

“He’s gay himself” as if that made it any better. Imagine being unaware that it was a joke and having another gay kid read those things and believing them. Things like that as harmful as rape jokes. Maybe your lovely friend should think twice.
that’s bc no one calls men “males”. when men say “females” it’s often used in place of “bitches”. if a bunch of women have said it’s disrespectful and we don’t like it don’t u think that maybe u should stop ?

Apart from the very apparent support of rape, it's homophobic in the way that it generalises gay men to be rapists, and makes all the moral implications there seem like a joke. It is also sexist due to the way it seems like men can't be victims of sexual assault.
The problem is spanking went out of vogue in the 80s, meaning a lot of people 16-38s, wouldn't necessarily think the reason their buts hurt is spanking. As a gay tho, I can only think of it as a pejorative for sex with a rape joke thrown in. Definitely don't use it?

Yes Rape, Misogyny and homo phobia , I once heard a comedian joke about how gay people to should be stripped naked, raped and then killed and the audience laughed , they celebrate him a lot in the blogs for constant acquisition of property and luxury vehicles
this is sexist., at many levels. and somewhat disconcerting. being homosexual cannot be a reason for ruling out rape charges. neither can use of "gay" as a couched sexist slur be acceptable
Except in that sense, nonbinary means that you aren't part of the binary, so you aren't male or female, just aligned. So it also doesn't make sense to be using terms for men and women. And to see an enby who likes women and call them a lesbian is wrong, like calling a trans woman

I say this often but it's worth repeating. I didn't realize what women go through every day until I started hanging out in the gay scene when I came out. Even though I love men, I don't like how they hit on me, grope me, and once try to rape me (which was apparently a "joke").

As I am a gay man I’ll explain this to you like you’re five. Immediately jumping to the defense of a grown man you do not know and forgiving him for Rape jokes made against WOMEN is not okay. I spit and twist all the time so I’ll joke about it anytime I see fit

u call urself woke but u LITERALLY used the term gay as an insult and made rape jokes ALL NIGHT uhhh ok honey
Homophobic jokes against male heroes, slut shaming and rape jokes against lady heroes, and a "corrective sex" joke against gay Batwoman.
The people who find these jokes and situations funny are straight men. And for them the threat of sexual assault is not something that they consider a possibility, and it’s not surprising that the majority of victims are gay or trans. Rape jokes are the worst so just stop.
The day so far: A gay man writes how gays can be sexist towards women, #FBrape pages &amp; a local gay comic who jokes about rape. Gosh.
@Dreysander1 I dunno.  Knowing what I know now or in today's environment, I would NOT date any girl from same school.
its melting because you didnt put it in the freezer before you served it you dumb skank! #MKR

In reality, it's worse than that. Because "everyone knows" rape of men is a joke, most gay men don't even conceptualize the assault as rape. That doesn't mean it doesn't still affect them - in fact, not being able to label and identify it properly makes it even worse.

As a gentleman, I find it disrespectful when dudes call a female a “bitch” when they talk about them.
@Saffronian Ahh, the militant feminazi finally came out. I never posted a single violent word, yet you spew violent hatred and insults.
Humor normalizes extreme situations. If you say that something is off limits like gay jokes and rape jokes, you are de-humanizing the subjects and saying they are too sensitive and weak to take a joke. So you do more harm than good.
Never made rape jokes. Homophobic? bitch they're gay for each other. Transphobic omg at least use correct facts https://twitter.com/ANAKINIDIOT/status/717090015050919936
I dnt care enuff to even call another female's name tbh, and I dnt normally gaf about any1 from the past anyway, never had to. However, if mi nuh like a gal, I'm gonna refer to her as exactly that, "gal" or simply, "bitch", and yuh cyaa correct mi needa

Except gay jokes are inherently tied to homophobia, if you aren't gay and make them. Sexual violence IS treated as the norm. We have rape crisis centers everywhere. If it wasn't the norm, why do we have so many rape crisis centers? Why do we teach women how to avoid it? 1/

The difference is pedophilia is an action. Being a racist or not liking gays is an emotion or state of thought. There is a big difference. Pedophilia is rape, and also entails mental, emotional, &amp; physical abuse. its also not OK to joke about killing gays or blacks or whoever
You are a fraud, gay jokes, victimizing rape victims, harassing children and making up bullshit. I won't tell anyone, don't worry..
Rape jokes aren’t funny. Self harm jokes aren’t funny. Suicide jokes aren’t funny. Body shaming jokes aren’t funny. Using gay as an insult isn’t funny. Slut shaming isn’t funny. Sexism isn’t funny. Mental illnesses aren’t funny. If you think they are, unfollow me.

if you call women “bitches” or “females”, i’m automatically gonna assume you’re a misogynist idc if you’re a woman either, we don’t do that here.

Okay but these are the exact people who got Vic fired for the exact same thing they’re doing. He made a harmless jellybean joke and got fired because it wasn't acceptable.

Rape jokes aren't funny. Body shaming jokes aren't funny. Using gay as an insult isn't funny. Trixie Mattel isn’t funny.

So she makes a joke about everyone being gay, when in reality a lot of it is rape and sexual assault. Then she makes a joke about being in jail, like her 10,000+ sq foot home isnt the size of a full prison that she has full access too, no barriers to keep her locked in....
Straight white men object to being told off for making rape jokes but think it's totally justified to bash a gay man to death following a non violent sexual advance ... Of course they hate #politicalcorrectness #auspol
Nah don't joke about rape, killing people and multiple other things that intentionally are known to upset others. That's saved for the lack luster end of the road comedians like Kevin Heart who bashed gays but then acted like it was cool with Nas X while being a smart ass.

Jokes about rape are like calling people gay: okay if you're a liberal. It's even better if you're a liberal and give it the one two punch of being a joke about prison rape. it's okay though because it offends people you don't like, which is the defining trait of morality.
Ok fair enough, 'T&RF' is only EVER used for ppl who challenge misogyny & homophobia (& anti-safeguarding) like these examples, ie a slur. NEVER, EVER for its supposed acronym. So ppl using the acronym excuse is like when boys go "'bitch' is a female dog so I can call you it'.
I'm gay. That's not a justification to make sexual jokes about little girls. That's like saying me being gay excuse rape jokes about women. Nah, man. Doesn't check out.
1/2 Rape isn’t funny. You know what is? That the crazy old men who joke about pretty women and rape are afraid that gay men are lusting after them. A: What if a gay man tries to have sex with me? B: Now you know how you make women feel.

I can call a man a fucking bitch too tho. So honestly i think the issue is women need to stop claiming words as female only offenses. Just bc hes a man doesnt mean he meant to “stick it to the woman”.

Finally, sexist jokes. Yes, the research shows that exposure to sexist humor, particularly related to sexual assault (rape jokes), can increase men’s aggression towards women and their self-reported willingness to rape a woman.

I didn't say it wasn't a derogatory term, just that it isn't necessarily sexist. When you call a female a bitch, are you really saying anything about her being a female or that she was acting in a way that was pissing you off? Her outrage is purely to politicize the interaction.

Stay strong Missionary Man. Don't let these feminazi fascists tell you where you can and cant piss @dontdoxmebro_ @Ishfery @Auragasmic
Yes Miley, because a date rape joke is the best way to advocate gay people. I should knock you out.

Just heard someone make a "gay" joke and a rape joke within a span of 2 minutes. Very cool... #overheardatUST
Is class shaming justified while condemning rape threats?? Make a gay, trans joke, and these people get triggered. Majority is not expected tolerate the type of shaming that's insulting to minorities just because it's majority.
@Noin007 THIS is why I find the "antifeminist women just want male attention" argument moronic...as if there aren't better ways to get that.

Anti-feminist YouTuber doubles down on vile Jess Phillips rape joke while leaping to the defence of a gay men’s rights activist
I'll always get a chuckle at kiddy-diddling joke because child molestation is horrible. What makes you laugh is subjective, but humor itself is not subjective. Let gay people laugh at homophobic jokes, let POC laugh at racist jokes, let rape survivors laugh at rape jokes, etc.
@jamiekilstein hey wasn´t you the guy making gay rape jokes on stage, yet you cried about rape jokes by a fellow comedian recently?

The only difference is you find it to be a topic that's not important TO you. If a Gay rape survivor said that Dave Chappelles jokes on those topics were inappropriate and disrespectful to them. The same would be true. It still wouldn't be Dave's job to tell jokes for them.

I'm waiting for them to go after Seth McFarland, of Family Guy & American Dad. The shows are full of jokes hostile to women, minorities, Jews, girls, gays. No one is safe. MANY related to child molestation &amp; rape. McFarland is a loyal 'woke' lefty, so he's been safe. So far. https://twitter.com/NolteNC/status/1021751920569077761

And that’s ok but it still not appropriate to call her a bitch for doing her job.Would you take that sitting down from a male or female coworker?I’d certainly hope not.Theres a certain decorum most ppl prefer from elected officials.This is not it.
Because people yell "stan Loona" to rape victims, shooting victims, and people who are mourning dead heterosexual Western celebrities that K-pop's cancel culture doesn't like. While Pewdiepie isn't actually racist at all, he just makes offensive jokes ironically.

Do all these jokes about eating horse meat give me license to make jokes about war, rape, gay bashing and genocide?
